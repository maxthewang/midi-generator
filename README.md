# MIDI Generator
My chosen final project for CSC111 (Winter 2021) at UofT. A Python tool that generates new chords and melodies based on the POP909 dataset.

Download the POP909 Dataset here: https://github.com/music-x-lab/POP909-Dataset

Unzip the POP909 folder into the `src` folder. `examples` folder contains sample MIDI files generated with this tool.
