# midi-generator
My chosen final project for CSC111 at UofT. A Python tool that generates new chords and melodies based on the POP909 dataset.

Download the POP909 Dataset here: https://github.com/music-x-lab/POP909-Dataset
Unzip the POP909 folder into the same folder that contains the Python files.
